# Bug Fixes and Code Improvements - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for addressing identified bugs, inconsistencies, and potential improvements in the DeletePy Auth0 User Management Tool. The goal is to enhance code quality, fix minor issues, and improve maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Rate Limiting Logic Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want rate limiting logic to be centralized in one location, so that configuration is consistent and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing rate limiting code THEN there SHALL be only one source of truth for rate limiting functions
2. WHEN `get_optimal_batch_size()` is called THEN it SHALL use the centralized implementation from `request_utils.py`
3. WHEN `get_estimated_processing_time()` is called THEN it SHALL use the centralized implementation from `request_utils.py`
4. WHEN duplicate functions are removed from `config.py` THEN all imports across the codebase SHALL be updated accordingly
5. WHEN rate limiting configuration is changed THEN it SHALL only need to be updated in one location

### Requirement 2: Error Handling Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want consistent error handling patterns throughout the codebase, so that errors are predictable and easier to troubleshoot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `_fetch_users_by_email()` receives an empty response THEN it SHALL handle the case consistently with other similar functions
2. WHEN any operation encounters an error THEN it SHALL use structured logging instead of mixed print statements
3. WHEN error messages are generated THEN they SHALL follow a consistent format across all modules
4. WHEN exceptions are raised THEN they SHALL use the appropriate custom exception types from the exceptions hierarchy
5. WHEN logging occurs THEN it SHALL use the centralized logging utilities consistently

### Requirement 3: Memory Usage Optimization

**User Story:** As a user processing very large datasets (>100k items), I want the checkpoint system to be memory efficient, so that operations don't fail due to memory constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checkpoint system loads `remaining_items` THEN it SHALL use streaming/pagination for datasets larger than 50,000 items
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed reasonable limits (configurable threshold)
3. WHEN memory usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL provide warnings to the user
4. WHEN very large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL implement batch-based checkpoint loading
5. WHEN memory optimization is active THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 4: Input Validation Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user providing input files, I want robust validation of email addresses and Auth0 user IDs, so that invalid inputs are caught early and clearly reported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email addresses are processed THEN they SHALL be validated using comprehensive email format checking
2. WHEN Auth0 user IDs are processed THEN they SHALL be validated against improved format rules
3. WHEN URL encoding is performed THEN email addresses SHALL receive additional validation for security
4. WHEN file paths are processed for checkpoints THEN they SHALL include additional security validation
5. WHEN invalid inputs are detected THEN clear, actionable error messages SHALL be provided

### Requirement 5: Test Coverage Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code quality, I want comprehensive test coverage for all edge cases, so that the codebase is robust and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checkpoint resume functionality is tested THEN there SHALL be integration tests covering all resume scenarios
2. WHEN social identity unlinking is tested THEN there SHALL be tests for all edge cases and error conditions
3. WHEN large dataset processing is tested THEN there SHALL be tests for memory optimization features
4. WHEN error handling is tested THEN there SHALL be tests for all custom exception types and scenarios
5. WHEN new functionality is added THEN test coverage SHALL remain at 100%

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user performing bulk operations, I want optimal performance for HTTP requests and user lookups, so that operations complete as quickly as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple HTTP requests are made THEN connection pooling SHALL be implemented to reduce overhead
2. WHEN repeated user lookups occur THEN caching SHALL be implemented to avoid duplicate API calls
3. WHEN batch operations are performed THEN optimal batch sizes SHALL be calculated based on dataset characteristics
4. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust request timing
5. WHEN performance optimizations are active THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 7: Code Organization Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want well-organized, maintainable code modules, so that development and maintenance are efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `batch_ops.py` is reviewed THEN it SHALL be split into smaller, focused modules if it exceeds 1000 lines
2. WHEN common patterns are identified THEN they SHALL be extracted into shared utility functions
3. WHEN code is refactored THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN modules are reorganized THEN import statements SHALL be updated consistently
5. WHEN code organization changes are made THEN documentation SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 8: Documentation Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer using the codebase, I want comprehensive inline documentation and troubleshooting guides, so that I can understand and use the code effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions are documented THEN docstrings SHALL include practical code examples where helpful
2. WHEN common issues occur THEN there SHALL be a troubleshooting guide with solutions
3. WHEN error messages are displayed THEN they SHALL include references to relevant documentation
4. WHEN new features are added THEN documentation SHALL be updated simultaneously
5. WHEN API changes are made THEN breaking changes SHALL be clearly documented

### Requirement 9: Security Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want robust input validation and secure file handling, so that the tool is safe to use in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user IDs are URL-encoded THEN the encoding SHALL be validated for security
2. WHEN file paths are processed THEN they SHALL be validated against path traversal attacks
3. WHEN checkpoint files are created THEN they SHALL have appropriate file permissions
4. WHEN sensitive data is logged THEN it SHALL be properly redacted or excluded
5. WHEN security validations are added THEN they SHALL not break existing functionality

### Requirement 10: Logging Standardization

**User Story:** As a system administrator monitoring operations, I want consistent, structured logging throughout the application, so that I can effectively monitor and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any module logs information THEN it SHALL use the centralized logging utilities
2. WHEN log messages are generated THEN they SHALL include appropriate context (operation, user_id, etc.)
3. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include sufficient detail for troubleshooting
4. WHEN logging configuration is changed THEN it SHALL apply consistently across all modules
5. WHEN structured logging is implemented THEN log parsing and analysis SHALL be improved
