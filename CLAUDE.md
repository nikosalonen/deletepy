# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is DeletePy, an Auth0 User Management Tool written in Python that allows bulk operations on Auth0 users including deletion, blocking, session/grant revocation, identity unlinking, and domain checking. The tool supports both development and production environments with safety confirmations for production operations.

## Architecture
The codebase follows a modern modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

### Key Components:
- **CLI Layer** (`src/deletepy/cli/`): Click-based command-line interface with modern argument parsing
- **Core Layer** (`src/deletepy/core/`): Authentication, configuration, and exception handling
- **Operations Layer** (`src/deletepy/operations/`): Business logic for Auth0 operations
- **Utils Layer** (`src/deletepy/utils/`): Shared utilities and helpers
- **Models Layer** (`src/deletepy/models/`): Data structures and type definitions

The application uses a generator pattern for memory-efficient file processing and implements rate limiting (0.2s between API calls) to prevent Auth0 API throttling.

## Environment Configuration
The tool requires a `.env` file with separate credentials for dev and prod:
- Dev environment uses `DEV_*` prefixed variables
- Prod environment uses standard variable names
- All operations in prod require explicit user confirmation

## Common Commands

### Setup
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (modern approach)
pip install -e .

# Or with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Important**: Always ensure the virtual environment is activated before running any commands. You can tell it's active when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

### Running Tests
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated first!
source venv/bin/activate

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_auth.py

# Run specific test function
pytest tests/test_auth.py::test_get_access_token_success
```

### Main Operations (New CLI)
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated first!
source venv/bin/activate

# Check authentication configuration
python -m src.deletepy.cli.main doctor [dev|prod]

# Check if specified users are unblocked
python -m src.deletepy.cli.main check-unblocked users.txt [dev|prod]

# Check email domains for specified users
python -m src.deletepy.cli.main check-domains users.txt [dev|prod]

# Export user last_login data to CSV
python -m src.deletepy.cli.main export-last-login emails.txt [dev|prod] [--connection CONNECTION]

# Find users by social media IDs (unlinks identities or deletes users)
python -m src.deletepy.cli.main unlink-social-ids social_ids.txt [dev|prod]

# User management operations
python -m src.deletepy.cli.main users block users.txt [dev|prod]
python -m src.deletepy.cli.main users delete users.txt [dev|prod]
python -m src.deletepy.cli.main users revoke-grants-only users.txt [dev|prod]
```

### Legacy Operations (Backward Compatibility)
```bash
# Legacy CLI still works with deprecation warnings
python main.py doctor [dev|prod]
python main.py users.txt dev --block
python main.py users.txt prod --delete
python main.py users.txt dev --revoke-grants-only
python main.py users.txt dev --check-unblocked
python main.py users.txt dev --check-domains
python main.py social_ids.txt dev --unlink-social-ids
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code with ruff
ruff format .

# Lint code with ruff
ruff check .

# Fix auto-fixable lint issues
ruff check --fix .

# Type checking (if mypy is installed)
mypy src/
```

## Development Guidelines

### Input File Handling
- Input files should contain one Auth0 user ID or email per line
- The tool handles both Auth0 user IDs (auth0|123456) and email addresses
- Social ID files should contain one social media ID per line for unlink-social-ids operation
- Large files are processed using generators to minimize memory usage

### Error Handling
- All Auth0 API calls include proper timeout handling (30s for operations, 5s for auth)
- Rate limiting prevents API throttling
- Production operations require explicit confirmation
- Email resolution handles multiple users per email with detailed reporting
- Custom exception hierarchy provides structured error handling

### Testing
- Tests use pytest with fixtures for mock objects
- `conftest.py` provides automatic module-based request mocking
- Each module has corresponding test files following `test_*.py` naming
- Tests cover both success and error scenarios for Auth0 API interactions
- Test coverage should be maintained at 100%

### Function Complexity Guidelines
To maintain code readability and testability, follow these rules for function complexity:

**Maximum Limits:**
- **50 lines per function** - Functions exceeding 50 lines should be refactored
- **4 levels of nesting** - Deeply nested code indicates need for extraction
- **10 variables** - Too many variables suggest the function does too much
- **5 parameters** - Functions with many parameters should be redesigned

**Refactoring Rules:**
- **Extract helper functions** when logic can be grouped into distinct operations
- **Use private functions** (prefixed with `_`) for internal utilities
- **Break down complex loops** that handle multiple concerns
- **Separate display logic** from business logic
- **Extract validation** and error handling into dedicated functions

**When to Refactor:**
- Function has multiple responsibilities (violates Single Responsibility Principle)
- Complex conditional logic with deep nesting
- Long parameter lists or too many local variables
- Repetitive code patterns within the function
- Difficulty in writing focused unit tests

### Social Identity Management
The `unlink-social-ids` operation provides sophisticated identity management:
- **Single Identity Users**: Users with only the matching social identity are deleted entirely
- **Multi-Identity Users**: Only the matching social identity is unlinked, preserving the user account
- **Protected Users**: Users with Auth0 as main identity are protected from deletion
- Production operations require explicit confirmation with operation counts

### Auth0 API Requirements
Required Auth0 Management API scopes:
- `delete:users` - for user deletion
- `update:users` - for user blocking
- `delete:sessions` - for session revocation (Enterprise plan)
- `delete:grants` - for application grant revocation
- `read:users` - for user lookups and identity management

### Module Import Guidelines
When working with the modular structure:
- Import from the new modular structure: `from deletepy.operations.user_ops import delete_user`
- Use absolute imports within the package
- Maintain backward compatibility by keeping legacy imports working
- Follow the established module boundaries and don't cross-import between operation modules

# Important Instructions
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
